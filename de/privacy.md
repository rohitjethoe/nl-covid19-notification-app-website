## About CoronaMelder

CoronaMelder (app) is a technical tool that helps limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus. If you have installed CoronaMelder on your smartphone, you will receive a message if you have been in the proximity (for some time) of a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, and this person has also installed CoronaMelder. If you may have been infected by another CoronaMelder user, the app recommends that you have yourself tested if you have any symptoms. Below we will briefly explain how CoronaMelder works.

The app recognises other smartphones on which the app is installed via Bluetooth Low Energy. The other smartphones are recognised using random codes (series of numbers) known as Rolling Proximity Indicators (RPIs). These codes are updated every 10 to 20 minutes, and are derived from Temporary Exposure Keys (TEKs). TEKs are also random codes, but are regenerated on a daily basis to be stored on the user's phone for 14 days. 

If your smartphone is in proximity to another smartphone on which the app is installed, their respective RPIs are exchanged and stored locally on those phones. If an app user has tested positive for COVID-19, the user may voluntarily choose to report this in the app. If the user chooses to do so, the app will send the TEKs created in the past 14 days and stored locally on the smartphone to a central server. The central server will only accept transmitted TEKs if the user and the Dutch Municipal Health Service (GGD) have confirmed such transmission with an authorisation code. On the central server, the TEKs received are converted into other codes known as Diagnosis Keys (DKs). 

The central server then makes the DKs available for automatic download by the smartphones on which the app is installed. After your smartphone has downloaded the DKs from the server, the phone will be disconnected from the server. This automated process is repeated several times per day to keep any contamination risks up-to-date. Your smartphone then calculates on the basis of the downloaded DKs whether there is a match with the various RPIs of other smartphones that have been in proximity to your smartphone. Immediately thereafter, the DKs will be removed from your smartphone. 

If there is a match, an assessment is made using a number of weighting factors as to whether there has been high-risk contact. If that is the case — in other words, if you have recently been in close proximity to a person infected with COVID-19 — you will be notified that there is an increased risk of contamination. The app also recommends having yourself tested for contamination with the virus if you have any symptoms.

## The field test

The field test will start on 17 August and will be conducted in collaboration with the Twente, Drenthe, Gelderland Zuid, Noord-Oost Gelderland and IJsselland GGD offices. Other GGD offices do not yet work with CoronaMelder at the time of the field test. CoronaMelder is available to all users in the app stores. You can therefore also download CoronaMelder even if you do not live in the geographical area of these field test regions. Only users living in the geographical area of the participating GGD regions can successfully upload the TEKs to the central server, because this requires an authorisation code from the GGD office. CoronaMelder's other functions remain the same.

### 1. Who is responsible for the processing of the personal data?

To the extent personal data are processed in the design and management of CoronaMelder, the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport is the controller.

In so far as the Municipal Health Service (GGD) uses personal data obtained via the app during source and contact tracing, your regional GGD is the controller. Visit [www.GGD.nl](https://www.ggd.nl) to find your GGD by entering the postal code of your home address.

### 2. For what purpose are personal data processed?

This app has been developed as an addition to source and contact tracing by the GGD. Its purpose is to quickly and easily inform users who have an increased risk of infection, while ensuring a high degree of anonymity. 

### 3. Basis for processing personal data

Personal data can be processed in the app. The basis for the processing of personal data is the explicit consent given by users for the processing of their personal data. Users must give explicit consent before the app can be used, and before users — when they have tested positive — can share their data with the GGD. The app cannot be used unless such consent is given. 

### 4. What personal data are processed?

The following data are processed in the app:

- Rolling Proximity Indicators (RPIs)
- Temporary Exposure Keys (TEKs)
- Diagnosis Keys (DKs)
- pseudo MAC address
- signal strength and duration of contact
- authorisation code
- Exposure Risk Value (high, mid, low)
- IP address

These data may be personal data.

A TEK is a randomly, cryptographically generated series of numbers serving as a temporary reference. TEKs are converted into DKs on the central server. In addition, an RPI is generated every 10 to 20 minutes, which is a temporary series of numbers that are also cryptographically generated. This series of numbers is a derivative of a TEK, and is exchanged with other smartphones on which the app is installed, and which have been in close proximity to the smartphone concerned for a specific period of time. The RPIs are transmitted and received via Bluetooth Low Energy and are thus used in combination with the signal strengths of both transmission and reception (to determine the distance between users), and the duration of the (Bluetooth) contact. The RPIs received are removed from the smartphones after 14 days. 

TEKs, DKs and RPIs are all pseudonymised identification keys.

In order to minimise the risk of users being identified, when TEKs are exchanged, the MAC address (a unique hardware number of the Bluetooth transmitter) of the smartphone is replaced by a randomly generated code, a pseudo MAC address, which, like the TEKs, changes every 10 to 20 minutes. 

The authorisation code is generated through a functionality provided by the app and is shown in the app. The authorisation code is used by the GGD to validate the TEKs sent to the GGD. The GGD places this authorisation code, with the date of the first day of illness, in the GGD portal. This GGD portal is only accessible to GGD employees. The central server only accepts user TEKs if an authorisation code is provided that has been validated by the GGD in this manner. During the validation phase, IP addresses are processed for administration and security purposes.

After validation, for each DK the date of the first day of illness is compared with the date of the newly received TEKs. On that basis, the central server determines the Exposure Risk Value (high, mid, low).

In addition to the DKs, the first day of illness and authorisation code, the IP address of the user's smartphone is sent to the central server. This is inherent to the use of Internet and IP technology. The IP address is stored separately from the other data, so that no IP addresses are stored on the central server. As a result, it is impossible to trace who sent which information.

### 5. Statistical information

The data collected with the app will only be used for the purposes stated in this privacy statement. No statistical information is generated. 

### 6. Who is provided with personal data?

The sending and receiving of RPIs takes place locally on users' smartphones. Once an infection has been detected, the user can choose to send his or her TEKs, along with a unique authorisation code, to the central server. The central server is administered by the CIBG with KPN as subcontractor (processor).

The GGD processes the authentication code, with the date of the first day of illness, in the app's GGD portal, which is only accessible to authorised GGD employees.

The smartphones of other users periodically – a few times a day – retrieve the data stored on this central server. 

### 7. Retention of personal data

The data stored locally on your smartphone will be retained for 14 days. After these 14 days, these data are automatically and permanently deleted. In addition, you are able to delete the stored data yourself at any time. 

In so far as your data are stored on the central server, they will be retained for 14 days from the time of uploading. After these 14 days, the data will be permanently deleted. 

IP addresses processed for administration and security purposes will be deleted after a maximum of 7 days.

### 8. Your rights with regard to your personal data

You have a number of rights to maintain control over your personal data. You can
find them [here](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl/onderwerpen/algemene-informatie-avg/rechten-van-betrokkenen) on the website of the Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens).

It is important to know in this respect that as long as you as a user have not come into contact with an infected person or have not agreed to provide data to the back-end server, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport nor the GGD offices will process (personal) data of you as a user, because in that case the data will only be stored on the user's telephone. At that stage, therefore, the rights mentioned above cannot yet be exercised towards the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and the GGD offices. 

Owing to the privacy-by-design nature of the app, it is impossible to trace which codes belong to the infected user after uploading the TEKs (and subsequently DKs). It is technically impossible for the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and the GGD offices to link the codes stored (temporarily) on the central server to users who uploaded their TEKs.
This is also technically impossible for the user, as no insight is given into the data and calculations on which the alert is based. In addition, the user's TEKs are removed automatically and periodically (after 14 days). Because it is impossible to identify the user through the codes, Article 11(2) GDPR contains no reason to give effect to the data subject's rights as referred to in Articles 15 through 20 GDPR after the TEKs have been uploaded to the central server. 

However, it is still possible to make a request invoking your privacy rights. You may send your request to the GGD responsible in your place of residence. On 
[www.GGD.nl](https://www.ggd.nl) you can enter the postal code of your home address to see which GGD is responsible in your place of residence.

You always have the right to lodge a complaint about the processing of your personal data with the Dutch Data Protection Authority or before the courts. More information about this can be found [here](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl/zelf-doen/gebruik-uw-privacyrechten/klacht-melden-bij-de-ap).

### 9. Protection of your personal data

The Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport and the GGD take the protection of your data seriously and take appropriate measures to prevent any abuse, loss, unauthorised access, undesired disclosures and unauthorised changes.

### 10. Amendment of privacy statement

This privacy statement is subject to amendment. In that case, we will publish the amended privacy statement on our website, after it will have immediate effect. You will be informed of any amendments relevant to you via the notifications in the app.
